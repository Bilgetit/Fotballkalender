# Fotballkalender

Program that scrapes the website altomfotball.no and sends weekly summary of matches, and which matches are available to watch for free on TV3+.

To run you need a .env file which contains username and password, and a .command file which has the executable to the file. To run the file each week, I used Task Till Dawn, which opens the .command file each week, therefore running the script.
